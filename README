qhtmlnodemodel - A QAbstractXmlNodeModel for HTML documents
===========================================================

qhtmlnodemodel is a QAbstractXmlNodeModel implementation for HTML documents. It
uses htmlcxx (http://htmlcxx.sourceforge.net/) for HTML parsing and offers the
document as a custom XML node model that can be used with Qt's XmlPatterns module.
This allows you to use XPath, XQuery, XSLT and other fun stuff on HTML documents
that aren't valid XML.

Usage is quite simple - please take a look at the examples and / or read
the usage notes at http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qabstractxmlnodemodel.html#usage .

The "library" constists of two source files and is licensed under 3-clause
